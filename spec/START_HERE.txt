The intended audience of the perlfive.com website is to provide a landing page
for people considering Perl as a technology.  These are two overlapping groups:

  1. Developers
  2. People who make buisness descisions about what technologies things are developed in

The philosophy behind the website is that we are trying to sell Perl as a technology
that matches the goals of those people.

In particular to create the following impression:

 - Perl is being used in high-profile websites on an enterprise level
 - Perl is under active development and has wide ranging community support
 - Perl is an approachable technology which:
   * makes completing the development goals simpler
   * and learning how to do this is easy
 - That Perl 5's future is not tied to the (widely seen as) vapourware of Perl 6
 
Non-goals of the project:

 - Teach people aspect of programming Perl itself
 - Service people who already use Perl in any way

Where roughly these sections are

1: title and strapline (apple example to copy: "iPhone 3GS" "The fastest, most powerful iPhone yet")

2: More detailed buzz word laden section

Brief explanation of what Perl is, written to the audience of someone who has a particular goal in mind.

3: Calls to action section, listing how to do things that you might want to do with Perl today (e.g. "start a website in minutes".)   This is THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH PERL not HOW TO LEARN PERL.  Concentration on meeting the GOALS of someone visiting the site.

At the very least this should have a sections on:

* Building enterprise level websites quickly and easily (blurb for catalyst)
* Managing complex databases trivially (blurb for DBIx-Class, with a nod to DBI and how this works on any database)
* Speeding up your existing non-perl website (blurb for memcached and how you can use it with other langauges - this makes us seem non-ghettoised too)
* Doing something very funky with Web 2.0 (leveraging big sections of CPAN to combine random bits of websites)

Note that these are *not* tutorials but marketing speals.  They're not very long (no more than a paragraph each) and each link to another page with the CTA "Learn More" at the bottom.

4. News section.

This differs from Perl Buzz and use.perl.org in several ways

- It's not a blog.  Items get replaced rather than rolling off the bottom (i.e. there's never going to be two stories about YAPC::Europe at the same time.)
- It's up-to-date news that's designed to last.  It's major stories, so it has things like:
  - Conferences
  - Releases of Perl (inc development releases)
  - Releases of important distributions (including, but not limited to: DBI, DBIx-Class, Moose, Catalyst)
  - Completion of big projects, grants, etc (but NOT announcement of these things)

The point of this news is NOT to inform, but rather to create an impression on the first time vistor to the site that Important Things Are Happening.   The headlines themselves should probably be of the form "Perl 5.10.1 RC releases on the 3rd March 2009".

5. Break out section.

The CPAN - There's a module for that

This page starts with a story in big letters.

"I sat down at my computer to develop <something here>.  


- Easy to install

Perl doesn't require you to hunt all over the web for various dependancies
to install extensions and follow baroque installation instructions for each
ne.  It's just as simply as typing

    cpan install <whatever>

And the cpan shell, which ships with Perl, will install your module and 
all it's dependancies for you.  Simple.

- Quality assured

Perl modules aren't just installed;  They're tested too.  Each module on the
CPAN ships with its own test suite and whenever you install a Perl module its
suite is run on your computer to make sure the module functions correctly for
you.

Want to know if the module is going to work before you get to that stage?  The
CPAN Testers test all modules that are deployed to CPAN on a wide range of
architectures so chances are, if there's a problem, you and the authour will
know about it before then.  No nasty suprises.

And if you do fine a bug or want a new feature each and every module on CPAN
has it's own dedicated bug tracking queue where you can contact the author
and keep

- Documented

Every perl module you install from CPAN includes documentation that can be
read on your computer, or accessed on the web at ....

- Reliable

Fed up with your build system falling over because it can't reliably download
the latest version of a project?  CPAN is widely mirrored....
