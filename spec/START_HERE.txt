The intended audience of the perlfive.com website is to provide a landing page
for people considering Perl as a technology.  These are two overlapping groups:

  1. Developers
  2. People who make buisness descisions about what technologies things are developed in

The philosophy behind the website is that we are trying to sell Perl as a technology
that matches the goals of those people.

In particular to create the following impression:

 - Perl is being used in high-profile websites on an enterprise level
 - Perl is under active development and has wide ranging community support
 - Perl is an approachable technology which:
   * makes completing the development goals simpler
   * and learning how to do this is easy
 - That Perl 5's future is not tied to the (widely seen as) vapourware of Perl 6
 
Non-goals of the project:

 - Teach people aspect of programming Perl itself
 - Service people who already use Perl in any way
