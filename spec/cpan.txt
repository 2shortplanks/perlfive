The CPAN - There's a module for that

########################################################################

This page starts with a story in big letters.

"I sat down at my computer to develop <something here>.  Turns out all
  I had to do was type:
  
    cpan install <something else here>

########################################################################

The next section of the page is a kind of "feature list" sales blurb about
the CPAN.  Something that looks a little like

- Easy to install

Perl doesn't require you to hunt all over the web for various dependancies
to install extensions and follow baroque installation instructions for each
ne.  It's just as simply as typing

    cpan install <whatever>

And the cpan shell, which ships with Perl, will install your module and 
all it's dependancies for you.  Simple.

- Quality assured

Perl modules aren't just installed;  They're tested too.  Each module on the
CPAN ships with its own test suite and whenever you install a Perl module its
suite is run on your computer to make sure the module functions correctly for
you.

Want to know if the module is going to work before you get to that stage?  The
CPAN Testers test all modules that are deployed to CPAN on a wide range of
architectures so chances are, if there's a problem, you and the author will
know about it before then.  No more nasty suprises.

- Documented

No more wondering how to use extensions.  Every Perl module you install from
CPAN includes documentation in a standard format that can be read on your
computer, or accessed on the web online before you install. Best of all,
the documentation always starts with a small concrete example
so you can jump right in and start using the module straight away.

- Supported

Still not quite understanding something about a module? Browse
the extensive annotations to the module documentation made by contributers.

Have questions?  Ask in the unique forum created for the CPAN module and
make use of the extensive knowledge of experts who've used the module before.

Got a problem?  Never fear, each module has a dedicated bug tracking queue
allowing you to file issues and make sure that they're dealt with promply.

- Easy to find what you're looking for

The CPAN has its own dedicated search engine that allows you quickly find
exactly the module you're looking for.

Need a recommendation?  See what modules your contacts rate, and read online
reviews of the module.

Want to know what module you should be using with this module?  Check out the
"See Also" section at the bottom of every module documentation listing other
things on CPAN you should be checking out.

- Reliable

Fed up with your build system falling over because it can't reliably download
the latest version of a project?  CPAN is widely mirrored....

- Take it on the go
